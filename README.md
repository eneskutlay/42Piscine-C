# What is 42Piscine?

42Piscine, where you can experience the education style of 42 software schools and at the same time become a student of this school if you are successful. 
It is a one-month challenging (but fun) training (selection) process to focus on core C and Shell topics.

# Shell And C

Shell and C are the two main issues that you will be heavily exposed to throughout this process. Throughout the course, you will focus only on these two topics. 
While Shell appears as a task only initially, C will be with you until the training is over. But don't try to ignore Shell because it will speed you up in exams and throughout the process and keep you one step ahead.

# No excuse!

You may not know anything before or a perfect developer. They really don't matter. Because 42 also questions your ability to socialize and learn together. 
So, will I have any problem in any part? You don't have to worry. Everyone will help you (and your others, of course). In addition to education, friends and new experiences will make you mature. So don't whine and try your luck

# Exams

Quizzes and all challenges are available online, so you don't have to worry. But remember to be fair and honest. 
It wouldn't be wise to try to memorize quizzes or pull all challenges from GitHub. Because you're not the first to think about it. You don't need to be afraid of exams and challenges. If you really try and try to understand, you will already learn many things and pass the exams. Sneaks will only slow you down and make you stupid.
